      This course is to show what benefits current and future quantum technologies can provide to machine learning, 
      focusing on algorithms that are challenging with classical digital computers. We put a strong emphasis on implementing 
      the protocols, using open source frameworks in Python. Prominent researchers in the field will give guest lectures to 
      provide extra depth to each major topic. These guest lecturers include Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Seth Lloyd, Roger Melko, and 
      Maria Schuld.
