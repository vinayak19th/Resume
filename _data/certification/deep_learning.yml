      This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning. Topics include: 
        
      - _Supervised learning_ - parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks 

      - _Unsupervised learning_ - clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning 

      - _Best practices in machine learning_ - bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI 
      

      The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning 
      algorithms in many cutting edge practical circumstances.

      This course covers a wide range of tasks in Natural Language Processing from basic to advanced: sentiment analysis, summarization, dialogue state tracking, to name a few. Upon completing, you will be able to recognize NLP tasks in your day-to-day work, propose approaches, and judge what techniques are likely to work well.  The final project is devoted to one of the most hot topics in today’s NLP. You will build your own conversational chat-bot that will assist with search on StackOverflow website. The project will be based on practical assignments of the course, that will give you hands-on experience with such tasks as text classification, named entities recognition, and duplicates detection.

      In this final course, you’ll explore four different scenarios you’ll encounter when deploying models. 
      You’ll be introduced to TensorFlow Serving, a technology that lets you do inference over the web. 
      You’ll move on to TensorFlow Hub, a repository of models that you can use for transfer learning. Then you’ll use 
      TensorBoard to evaluate and understand how your models work, as well as share your model metadata with others. Finally, 
      you’ll explore federated learning and how you can retrain deployed models with user data while maintaining data privacy.

      This course teaches you how to use a suite of tools in TensorFlow to more effectively leverage data and train your model. 
      You’ll learn how to leverage built-in datasets with just a few lines of code, use APIs to control how you split your data, 
      and process all types of unstructured data. <br><br>
      I personally incorporated my learning in this course into my internship at Myelin Foundry to test viability of project 
      deployment in Tensorflow.js for web browser based inference. This was done for multiple projects.

      In the first course of this specialization, we will recap what was covered in the Machine Learning with TensorFlow
      on [Google Cloud Platform Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp). So, 
      this course is set up as a workshop and in this workshop, you will do End-to-End Machine Learning with TensorFlow on 
      Google Cloud Platform.
      Deployment of models using GCP is essential for scaling performance.

      This course teaches you learn how to train and run machine learning models in any browser using TensorFlow.js. 
      You’ll learn techniques for handling data in the browser, and at the end you’ll build a computer vision project that 
      recognizes and classifies objects from a webcam.<br><br>

      In this 1.5-hour long project-based course, you will learn to create a custom callback function in Keras and use 
      the callback during a model training process. We will implement the callback function to perform three tasks: 
      Write a log file during the training process, plot the training metrics in a graph during the training process, and 
      reduce the learning rate during the training with each epoch.
