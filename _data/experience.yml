    As part of a team of student researcher under the <b>Samsung PRISM</b> program, I worked on:
      * <b>Online Handwritting Recognition</b> in <b>Bengali</b> and <b>Tamil</b>. 
      * The <i>dataset</i> was collected by us on campus and comprised of 1300 Handwritting samples. 
      * The data was in the form of <b>XML Files</b> with <b>(x,y,t)</b> information.
      * The model we chose to use was an <b>attention based LSTM</b> to learn more information. 
      * This model was combined with a <b>pre-trained language model - BERT</b> to improve the accuracy of our predictions.
